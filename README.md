# highstreethub social/digital media CRM 

# Scope

highstreethub is a social/digital media CRM for a small business (1-5 employees) can manage their clients, leave notes, and audit potential clients before 
making sales calls. It's supposed to be a very simplified version of some of the other major CRM's available. Sometimes you don't need all the extra's.

# User Stories

as a highstreethub user, you want to be able to create a client, audit the clients presence and be able to leave notes for any interaction you have with
the client in order to ensure the next person who speaks with them knows what was previously discussed OR so the person in charge of making changes to an
account/platform can do so accurately. The user should also be able to create posts from the images available for the client and view previous posts for 
inspiration and to make sure the user is not making the same post that was recently made (the images, posting, and notes are currently unavailable for version
one. Version 1 is simply an MVP which allows for client creation and auditing. Notes is the next big addition that needs to be made)

# Approach

From my previous experience working for GoDaddy social, I knew better what the scope of this project could be. Because there are many different business segments using the same tool, planning ahead for those future possibilities provided for better thinking of scalability in the future if the small business becomes medium
or large in the future. With that being said, trying to keep it as simple as possible without a knowledge base is essential for the small business.

# Milestones 

I only had 2 weeks to get this built out for the capstone project of the General Assembly bootcamp, so it was very important to make sure it was deployed and 
working even if all the features were not added yet. While accomplishing this more tough than expected, I still want to add at least the note taking feature
before putting the project down for a while.
